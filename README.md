**DOMAIN** : FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

**BATCH DURATION** : NOVEMBER 8th, 2024 to DECEMBER 8th, 2024

**MENTOR NAME** :

The goal of this task was to build a real-time collaborative document editor, allowing multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously. The key technologies used in this task were React.js (or Vue.js for an alternative), JavaScript, Node.js, and WebSocket. React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering, making it ideal for creating a dynamic and responsive UI for the document editor. WebSocket was used to facilitate real-time communication between the users, ensuring that updates made by one user are immediately reflected on the other users' screens. The backend server was built using Node.js, and it handled user connections, document updates, and broadcasted changes in real-time using Socket.IO or WebSocket. The server also managed user sessions and ensured that document data was synchronized across multiple users. For storing the document data, MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) was used to persist the documents in a database, enabling users to save their work and continue editing later. This application mimicked collaborative tools like Google Docs, allowing teams to work on documents simultaneously with live updates. The frontend was built with React.js for a seamless user experience, while the backend used Node.js to handle requests, manage real-time events, and ensure efficient data management.
